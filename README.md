# 🌐 Web Data Extraction and Summarization Tool (WDEST)

### 🚀 Overview

**Web Data Extraction and Summarization Tool (WDEST)** is an AI-powered application that extracts meaningful content from web pages and automatically generates concise summaries using a Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on **Groq**.  

It provides a simple, interactive **Streamlit** interface where users can input a URL, extract the page data, and instantly view a summarized version of its content.  

This project aims to simplify research and save time for students, journalists, and professionals who deal with large amounts of online information.

## 🧠 Project Motivation

There’s too much unstructured information on the internet. Finding relevant data quickly and understanding it takes time.  
Our tool automates this process — it **scrapes**, **processes**, and **summarizes** web data into an easy-to-digest summary.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of three main modules:

1. **Web Scraper** – Extracts readable content from the given URL using `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup`.
2. **Summarizer** – Sends the extracted content to an **OpenAI OSS model hosted on Groq** for summarization.
3. **User Interface (UI)** – Built with `Streamlit` to provide a clean, simple, and interactive experience.
